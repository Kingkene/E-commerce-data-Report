# Summary
The most ordered product type is Technology, it has the highest number of orders and the highest revenue and profit. Japan has the highest total Profit with a high number of orders. The country with the highest average Revenue is China followed by India Both countries have the same average Profit. Although Pakistan had the highest number of orders it did not generate high revenue.
Advertisements should be focused more on China to increase the number of their orders which would lead to more Revenue generation.

# Recommendations

- Technology products should be the focus to yield more revenue.
- Increased advertisements should be focused in China to create more awareness and increase sales.
- Japan is our most profit-yielding country in technology products, so we should ask for customer reviews and use their reviews to promote our products in other countries. ðŸ˜„
